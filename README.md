#About

**jQuery Depeche Mode**

Allows a user to select items from a list with number keys on the keyboard 0 to 9, where 0 equals 10.

Once the line is highlighted then you can hit the following keys to click the link:
s = Show
e = Edit
d = Destroy
t = Tag

All these links must be ajax links so that the click function works.  You might want to use my jQuery.Beeline plugin.
